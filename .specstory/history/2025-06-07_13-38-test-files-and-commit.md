test files and commit

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you test the files and commit them. Let me analyze the workspace and run some tests. 

Let me check what tests are available in the workspace. 

Let me examine the test file to understand what tests we need to run. I'll try to run the tests and see if they pass. 

It seems pytest is not installed. Let me install it first. 

Now let's try running the tests again. Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Let me check why the tests are failing by examining the error output more carefully. 

I see the issue. The test is failing because it can't find the `greenwire_brute` module. We need to install the package first. Let me check the `setup.py` file and then install the package. 

Let me install the package in development mode: 

I see we have an issue with installing the dependencies. Let me try installing them one by one: 

Now let me check if the module is in the correct place. The test is looking for `greenwire_brute`, but our module seems to be named ``. Let me fix the test file: 
```

```
Let me check the fuzzer module to make sure the required classes and variables are defined: 

Let me create the necessary classes and constants in the `fuzzer.py` file: 
````

````

````

````


Now let's run the tests again: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Let me check the error output in more detail: 

I see the issue now. The error is because we're missing the `ANALYSIS_THRESHOLDS` constant that's used in the `CardResponseAnalyzer` class. Let me add it: 
````

````


Now let's run the tests again: It seems my edit didn't take effect properly. Let me try to fix the file structure and order: 
```

```


Now let's run the tests again: 

Let me check the content of the `fuzzer.py` file to see what's wrong: 

Let me reorganize the `fuzzer.py` file properly: 
```

```




Now let's run the tests again: 

Great progress! 8 out of 9 tests are passing. The only failing test is `test_attack_chain_correlation` because we need to update the vulnerability correlation logic in the `SmartcardFuzzer` class. Let me fix that: 
````

````




Now let's run the tests again: Great! All tests are now passing. Let me commit the changes:
