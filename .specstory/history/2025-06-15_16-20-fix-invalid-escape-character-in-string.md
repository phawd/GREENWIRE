### [settings.json](vscode-userdata:/c%3A/Users/cross/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/settings.json)

No changes are needed in this file for installing OpenJDK, as this is a VS Code settings file.  
To install OpenJDK, you should download and install it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), and then set the `jdk.jdkhome` path accordingly (which you already have).

Regarding "remove f:\ from the repo":  
There is no reference to `f:\` in this file, so no changes are needed here.

**Summary:**  
- No changes required in this file for your requests.
- To install OpenJDK, follow the installation instructions from the official site.
- If you need to remove `f:\` references from your repository, please specify the files containing such references.

_**Assistant**_

There is no `.gitmodules` file or any directory listing provided in your current input.  
If you want to check for references to `f:\` in your repository, you should:

1. Search for `.gitmodules` in your repo root (typically contains submodule paths).
2. Search all files and directories for any references to `f:\` and remove or update them as needed.

**If you want to create or update a `.gitmodules` file, or want to check specific directories, please provide the relevant files or directory listings.**

_No changes are needed in the provided `settings.json` file for this request._
