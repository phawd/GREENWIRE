# GREENWIRE Emulator (emulator.py)
# --------------------------------
# Purpose: Unified emulator for NFC, smartcard, and terminal operations, including ISO 14443, ISO 15693, ISO 18092, and EMV simulation.
# Relative to: Used by GREENWIRE CLI and test suites for protocol simulation, fuzzing, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
# Protocols: ISO 14443, ISO 15693, ISO 18092, EMV, ISO 7816, PCSC, NFC.
#
# Will move GreenwireEmulator and related functions here
