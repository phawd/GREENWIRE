_**Assistant**_

To test readers connected with fuzzing and other commands, you can use the `greenwire-brute.py` script with the appropriate mode and options. Here's how you can proceed:

### Steps:
1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed**:
   - Make sure all required Python libraries (e.g., `smartcard`, `nfc`) are installed. If not, install them using `pip`.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Use the `--mode` option to specify the testing mode (e.g., `fuzz`, `readfuzz`, etc.).
   - Use the `--type` option to specify the card type (e.g., `visa`, `mc`, etc.).
   - Add other options like `--verbose` for detailed logging or `--export` to save results.

3. **Example Commands**:
   - **Fuzzing Mode**:
     ```bash
     python greenwire-brute.py --mode fuzz --type visa --verbose
     ```
   - **Read Record Fuzzing**:
     ```bash
     python greenwire-brute.py --mode readfuzz --type mc --verbose
     ```
   - **Extract Keys**:
     ```bash
     python greenwire-brute.py --mode extractkeys --type amex --verbose
     ```

4. **Check Logs**:
   - Review the logs (`greenwire-brute.log` and `greenwire-anomaly.log`) for detailed results and anomalies.

5. **Database Results**:
   - If the database is used, you can query `greenwire.db` for session details, commands, vulnerabilities, etc.

Would you like me to automate or modify anything in the script to streamline this process?

automate everything possible and modify it to be consise without redundancies but also don't be afraid to add libraries you may not need.
