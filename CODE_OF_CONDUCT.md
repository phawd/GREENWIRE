I. PURPOSE & VALUES

The NEXA community is built on the foundation of respectful collaboration, technical excellence, and mutual accountability. Our shared spaces are designed to foster professional engagement and innovation in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or abuse of any kind.

By participating in this community, members agree to uphold the spirit and intent of this Code of Conduct. This document exists not to police, but to protect the integrity, inclusivity, and professionalism that define our work.

We welcome all contributors regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation.

II. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

To ensure a thriving, productive, and welcoming community, members are expected to:

Demonstrate Empathy and Kindness: Communicate with consideration and care. Assume good intentions but clarify misunderstandings promptly.

Respect Different Opinions and Backgrounds: Diversity in thought, background, and experience is a strength. Engage in dialogue rather than debate. Critique ideas, not individuals.

Offer and Receive Constructive Feedback: Feedback should be specific, relevant, and considerate. Respond to critique with a mindset of growth and curiosity, not defensiveness.

Take Ownership of Mistakes: Acknowledge errors, apologize sincerely, and take meaningful steps to rectify any harm done.

Support the Greater Good: Make decisions that benefit the collective community rather than personal ambition. Prioritize sustainability, clarity, and collaboration.

III. UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

Certain actions are inconsistent with our community values and will not be tolerated. These include:

Sexualized Language or Imagery: Includes inappropriate jokes, content, or behavior, whether online or in person.

Personal Attacks and Insults: This includes name-calling, demeaning language, or malicious mockery of individuals or groups.

Harassment: Includes repeated unwanted contact, stalking, intimidation, threats, or disparagement in any form.

Disclosure of Private Information Without Consent: This includes doxing, publishing personal or identifying information without explicit permission.

Aggressive or Disruptive Conduct: Sustained interruptions, hijacking discussions, or behavior that significantly detracts from productive engagement.

IV. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

This Code applies across all official community spaces including:

Public repositories, forums, chat channels, mailing lists, and collaborative platforms.

Events, meetings, and conferences (virtual or physical) under the NEXA name or representation.

Any context where a community member is officially representing NEXA, such as speaking engagements or social media activity linked to their role in the project.

Note: Actions in personal venues (e.g., personal social media or blogs) may be considered within scope if they directly affect the integrity or safety of the community.
