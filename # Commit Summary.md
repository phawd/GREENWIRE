## Add EMV test framework with attack scenarios and vulnerability correlation (f1f3580)

Add EMV test framework with attack scenarios.

This commit introduces a new EMV test framework, including attack scenario simulations and vulnerability correlation. The primary addition is `greenwire/core/fuzzer.py`, which implements the core fuzzing logic and database interaction.

### Changes
- Creation of `greenwire/core/fuzzer.py`: This file contains the core logic for EMV card fuzzing, including attack scenario simulations, vulnerability detection, and database interaction. It defines constants for EMV standards, attack scenarios, card OS commands, and EMV tags.
- Addition of database functionality using SQLite to store session data, command history, vulnerabilities, keys, and timing analysis.
- Implementation of logging with different handlers for various data types (vulnerabilities, keys, timing) and verbosity levels.
- Updates to `README.md` to include usage examples for the Python unified CLI `greenwire.py` and Perl SMS CLI.

### Impact
- Introduces a new EMV card testing capability with simulated attack scenarios to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Adds database persistence for test results and vulnerability tracking.
- Increases code complexity due to the introduction of fuzzing logic, database interaction, and logging.
- Requires the installation of Python 3.x and potentially Perl and OpenSSL if not already present.
