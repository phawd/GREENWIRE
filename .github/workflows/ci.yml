# GitHub Actions Workflow for GREENWIRE CI/CD
# This workflow automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the
# GREENWIRE project.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3.11 with pip to install packages from ``requirements.txt``.
# - Java 17 and Gradle to build ``JCOPCardManager`` into ``GREENWIRE.jar``.
# - PC/SC compatible reader drivers (``pcscd``/``libpcsclite``) for smartcard
#   integration.
# The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the ``main`` branch.
