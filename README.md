## Unified CLI: `greenwire.py`

`greenwire.py` is the main command-line tool for EMV card issuing, smartcard fuzzing, JCOP/JavaCard management, logging, replay, and field/production testing. It supports both research and real-world/field use, with robust CA certificate/key support for EMV/terminal emulation and card issuance.

### Key Features
- Modular CLI for card generation, fuzzing, simulation, and hardware/CSV output
- Realistic HSM/terminal simulation (PCSC, NFC, HSM profiles)
- Robust logging, operator feedback, and cryptographic verification
- EMV/JCOP/ISO 7816/JavaCard support
- CA certificate/key support for EMV/field testing

## CA Certificate/Key Support for EMV & Field Testing

GREENWIRE supports CA key/certificate management for EMV/terminal emulation and card issuance. The CA key file is a JSON array of objects with `rid`, `index`, `modulus`, and `exponent` fields, e.g.:

```json
[
  {
    "rid": "A000000003",
    "index": "92",
    "modulus": "C1D2E3F4A5B6C7D8E9F0C1D2E3F4A5B6C7D8E9F0C1D2E3F4A5B6C7D8E9F0C1D2",
    "exponent": "03"
  }
]
```

**To use your own CA key/cert:**
1. Add your CA key/cert to `ca_keys.json` in the above format.
2. Use the `--ca-file ca_keys.json` option with relevant CLI commands (e.g., `issuance`, `emulator`, `install-cap`).
3. For field/production use, ensure your CA key matches the card/AID you are issuing or testing.

**Example: Card Issuance with Custom CA Key**
```bash
python greenwire.py issuance --csv-output cards.csv --hardware --profile pcsc --ca-file ca_keys.json
```

**Example: Install .cap File with Custom AID and CA Cert**
```bash
python greenwire.py install-cap --cap-file myapplet.cap --tool gpp --aid A0000000031010 --ca-file ca_keys.json
```

**To validate a CA key/cert:**
- Check that the `rid` and `index` match the card/AID you are working with.
- Use the `issuance` or `emulator` subcommands with your CA file and verify successful operation/log output.

## Example CLI Usage

**Fuzzing and Brute Force:**
```bash
python greenwire.py supertouch --cap-files mytest.cap --csv-output results.csv
```

**JCAlgTest Simulation:**
```bash
python greenwire.py jcalgtest --cap-files mytest.cap
```

**Emulator with Hardware Profile:**
```bash
python greenwire.py emulator --cap-file mytest.cap --profile nfc --hardware
```

**Replay Mode:**
```bash
python greenwire.py replay --cap-file mytest.cap
```

**Audit Mode:**
```bash
python greenwire.py audit --cap-file mytest.cap
```

**Install .cap File (GlobalPlatformPro):**
```bash
python greenwire.py install-cap --cap-file myapplet.cap --tool gpp --aid A0000000031010
```

## Simple Menu Interface

For quick experiments, run the lightweight menu-based wrapper:

```bash
python menu_cli.py
```

This script offers an interactive menu for common tasks built on top of the main `greenwire` toolkit.

## Field/Production Notes

- For field testing, always use the `--hardware` and `--profile` options to select the correct terminal/HSM profile (e.g., `pcsc`, `nfc`, `hsm`).
- Ensure your CA key/cert is valid and present in `ca_keys.json` for EMV/issuance operations.
- Use the `--csv-output` option to log results for compliance and audit.
- For contactless/NFC operations, ensure `nfcpy` and compatible hardware are installed.
- For Android-based NFC, connect your device via ADB and use the appropriate profile.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: My card issuance fails with a CA key error.**
A: Check that your CA key/cert in `ca_keys.json` matches the card/AID. Ensure the modulus and exponent are correct and the file is valid JSON.

**Q: Hardware not detected?**
A: Ensure your PCSC/NFC reader is connected and drivers are installed. For Android, check ADB connection.

**Q: How do I add a new CA key/cert?**
A: Edit `ca_keys.json` and add a new object with the correct `rid`, `index`, `modulus`, and `exponent`.

**Q: How do I verify my CA key is being used?**
A: Run `issuance` or `emulator` with `--ca-file` and check the logs/output for your CA key details.
